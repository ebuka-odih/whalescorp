                    <h2><strong>Notes to consider</strong> before making a withdrawal</h2>
                    <ul class="dotted_ul">
                        <li>Traders Corp does not charge any internal fees for deposits or withdrawals. However, please note payments to and from overseas banking institutions may attract intermediary transfer fees from either party which are independent of Traders Corp. Any such fees will be the responsibility of the client.</li>
                        <li>Due to AML / CTF laws, Traders Corp cannot deposit funds to third parties. All money withdrawn from your account must go to a bank account in the same name as your Traders Corp trading account.</li>
                        <li>All withdrawal requests are processed Monday to Friday 9am-7pm (AEST). Requests received after 7pm will be processed on the next business day. Please note that our bank cut off time is 4pm (AEST) and withdrawals processed after this time will not leave our bank account until the next business day. *Please note that we are currently experiencing delays due to excessive demand, and we apologise for any inconvenience.</li>
                        <li>All withdrawal requests are processed according to the funding source of origination. For example a deposit is made via Debit/Credit Card; then a subsequent withdrawal request is received. The amount of funds sent back to the relevant Debit/Credit Card, when a withdrawal request is received, may not exceed the original amount deposited from same. Any profits made in excess of the deposited amount will be transferred to the nominated bank account; which must be held in the same name as your trading account. </li>
                        <li>If you deposited funds through the Traders Corp App or reside in Canada, you may be unable to withdraw via credit card due to NAB gateway restrictions. Instead, your funds will be withdrawn to your designated bank account.</li>
                        <li>Debit/Credit Card withdrawal can only be used for the deposit amount made using a Debit/Credit Card.</li>
                        <li>Debit/Credit Card refunds can take between 3-5 business after successfully approved by Traders Corp to appear on your statement.</li>

                        <li>International  Telegraphic Transfers attract a minimum bank processing fee of 20 units of your account base currency i.e. 20 AUD.
